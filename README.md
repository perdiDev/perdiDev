###### Hi, I'm Perdi, a student of engineering at University of Hasanuddin and a backend developer. I am passionate about using technology to make a difference, and excited to start my career in 2023. I'm looking forward to a great career in [2023](https://www.instagram.com/perdidev/) with AI. 

###### I am on a journey to unlock the full potential of technology. As a student of Informatics Engineering at the University of Hasanuddin, I am constantly seeking new challenges to test my skills and push the boundaries of what is possible. As a backend developer, I am fascinated by the intricacies of data and algorithms, and how they can be used to create powerful, innovative solutions. With a deep understanding of both theory and practice, I am poised to make my mark in the field and make an impact in the world from 2023 onward.
